It allows developers to write server-side code in JavaScript, leveraging the same language used for client-side programming. Node.js is built on Google's V8 JavaScript engine and provides asynchronous I/O operations, enabling non-blocking code execution.","imgUrl":"","headingNumber":1},{"heading":"Advantages of Node.js","paragraph":"Node.js enables the development of fast web servers using event-driven programming. It uses a simplified model with callbacks to signal task completion, eliminating the need for threading. Node.js combines the ease of JavaScript with powerful Unix network programming capabilities.","imgUrl":"","headingNumber":2},{"heading":"Fundamentals of Node.js","paragraph":"Node.js provides asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library, allowing developers to write non-blocking code. It offers modules for file system I/O, networking, cryptography functions, and more.
